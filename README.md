# V-Motor

**V-Motor** is one of the components for creating a humanly operating LLM system, serving as an element that performs functions related to motor movement in the LLM brain. V-Motor takes visual environments and abstract intentions written in natural language as input, then plans and executes these abstract intentions as concrete mouse and keyboard inputs. It can handle tasks ranging from simple icon clicking to tracking moving objects, with its scope limited to simple tasks that do not require conscious judgment. V-Motor can control its own movements by receiving visual feedback and can modify or halt movements upon receiving commands during execution.

It would be nice to have an actual robot, but V-Motor is currently aimed at manipulating computer screens. Next, we plan to try models for 3D games.
